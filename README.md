# openVALIDATION

openVALIDATION enables programming of complex validation rules using natural language.
Type your rules in English or German, pass them to our CLI, get readable ready-to-use source code in Java, JavaScript or C#.

## OpenAPI integration

Or use our [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) integration,
add rules to your service contract and generate service stubs with a complete validation layer.

## So where is the source code?

```
